    <p>My name is Kelby Wilson and I have lived in the Bay Area most of my life. I recently moved from Martinez to Concord.
         I live with my wife and two housemates and two dogs, our dog's name is Hawkeye and fetch is his love language.
     </p>
    <p>I am currently enrolled in a data analytics bootcamp through UC Berkeley and I hope to transition into the tech world as a career change.
        I previously worked as a sales representative for Nestle for 10 years, working with their frozen foods products in grocery stores.
